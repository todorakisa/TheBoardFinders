    Hello my Friend. Wellcome to The Fans guide to the Board Games. This Guide will navigate you trough our site BoardFind.
    Once you go to our home page you can click the button “Join Us”. It will lead to the the registration where you can registrate or sign in. To register click “Sign up”. You need to fill alll the fields with correct Email,Username,Strong password and accept our Terms of use and Privacy Policy then press the button “Register now” to create your account or  You can login by clicing “Sign in” then typing Username and Password and then click “Go In”. It will lead you to our EventsAndPeople page where there is an navigation bar and a button “Sign out”, so you can sign out at any time. Here the funs begins. It will show a map of your region with all game events near you.You can click them and see the information about them. Unfortunately for now the part with cliking doesn’t work but in the future we will fix it. When we fix it you will see the information abaout every event and you will have the opportunity to contact the people at the event. Every registered event has an emails of all the people who will participate so you can contact them at any time and join their board game gathering. When you go to our EventsAndPeople page after the map and the info you will see two buttons. The first button is to create an event. After you click it you will be redirected to another page whre it will have another map with poiner in the center. To create an event you will have to point a place whre it will hapen. You can do this in two ways. First is to drag the cursor to the right place on the map and it will automaticaly get the coordinates or the second way is you personaly to write them in the fields below the map. These fields are for registrating an event. You should think up a name for your event. Then write the games which will be at the event like Poker,Catan,Misterium or else. Then you have to write all of the emails of your friends which you will play with at the event. If you dont have don’t worry, write only your email and after other players see your event and write you that they wish to join, you can edit the event and add their emails. The last thing you need to do when registraiting an event is to add a description. It’s not necessary to add a description but is recommended, because when other people see you event they might have questions about it which will be answered if you add description. But if you are shy or don’t want to create an event then waht? Well don’t worry again because you can go to EventsAndPeople page and click the button “see all events”. There you can see all events near you and click them to see information about them. You can cantact the creators of the events by their emails. In future we will fix the map in EventsAndPeople and there you will also had an opportunity to see all events near you. In our site there is always a navigation bar with several options. First is our EventsAndPeople page which we explained and then is trade wich is under work and is not ready yet even for explaining. Then is our wiki page where we will also show you how to use our site. Then is Account opion but it’s not ready too. It will have some baisic information about you profile and when you are in an event we will link you email to your profile, so players know something more about you. And the last option is “About Us” where you can learn something more about us if you want.
